-- 1. Error: failed to run config for telescope-fzf-native.nvim
--    This tool need to build using gcc, clang and make, make sure these are installed
--    If these C tools are not installed during nvim first launch, chance are the build
--    process will fail. Solution is to go to ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/ and delete the
--    telescope-fzf-native.nvim/ directory. Re launch nvim and start the installation
--    all over again.
